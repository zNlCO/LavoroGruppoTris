Visual Studio Live Share
Real-time Collaborative Development
Welcome to Visual Studio Live Share! Get your team started with collaborative editing and debugging in just a few simple steps:

Invite
Send the session URL to the developers you'd like to collaborate with (up to 30!), using e-mail, Skype, Slack, etc. View security info to understand more about secure sharing.

Want to evaluate VS Live Share but don't have anyone to collaborate with? No problem! You can actually join your own session from another instance of VS Code.

Collaboration session URL:

Copy invite linkTry joining yourself
Collaborate
That's it! Once an invited "guest" joins, you'll get a notification, and will see their cursor appear in your currently opened file. All guests will start out "following" you, which means that as you scroll or navigate between files, they will track those actions as well. This makes it easy to orient them with the issue/question/task you're about to start collaborating on.

Additionally, to get the most out of Live Share, open up the Session Details view (shown to the right) and try out the following things:

Move your cursor, edit and highlight text, and watch guests do the same
Follow a guest, and have them scroll and/or navigate to other files
Share a debug session, by pressing F5, then stepping together in real time
Share a server, so guests can view a locally running web app, database, etc.
Share a terminal and run commands collaboratively
Start a voice call using the VS Live Share Audio extension

If you run into any problems, see our troubleshooting documentation for potential workarounds. Additionally, if you have any questions and/or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out to the team on GitHub.
